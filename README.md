# ATtiny85_USB_PCB
I designed a USB circuit based on ATtiny85 using KiCad software. The process involved creating schematics, PCB layout, and optimizing the circuit for better performance. Additionally, I created footprints and symbols for some of the components to ensure accurate placement on the PCB. Finally, I generated Gerber files for production.
